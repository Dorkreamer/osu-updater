# How to use
This works as a launcher, you'll just execute this and if there's an update available, it will automatically download it for you before launching the game.

# How it works
It checks the [official osu! GitHub repo](https://github.com/ppy/osu/) for new releases everytime you start this launcher and if the latest version doesn't match your current one, it'll download the .AppImage for the most recent release of the game.
